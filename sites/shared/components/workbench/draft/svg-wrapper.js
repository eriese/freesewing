/* What's with all the wrapping?
 *
 * Glad you asked. The problem lies within the pan & zoom functionality
 * For this to work, we need to reliably determine the container widht
 * However, our SVG is optimized for embedding (no width or height)
 * which means it will simply adapt to the parent container.
 * So now we have a parent container adapting to the content and the
 * content adapting to the parent. This creates a sort of stalemate
 * where the browser will render this as zero width and height.
 *
 * To avoid that, we use the SizeMe which will report the size of the
 * grandparent element, and then we wrap our SVG in a div that we
 * set to this size. This will cause the SVG to fill in that entire
 * space, and the pan and zoom to adapt to this size.
 *
 * Note that this also means that changing the browser window size
 * will cause things to get clipped until the next render.
 *
 * Also still to see how this will work with SSR
