The **FreeSewing revenue pledge** states that:

> ## All FreeSewing revenue will be donated to [Doctors Without Borders (MSF)](http://www.msf.org/)

The pledge is made and enforced by the FreeSewing maintainer (joost).
You can read about [his motivations for doing so on this page](/docs/various/pledge/motivation/).
