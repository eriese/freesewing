## Step 1: Constructing the Pocket Bag

- Bind the pocket slit.
- With _wrong sides together_ stitch the two pocket pieces together around the outside.
- Bind the outside edge.

<Note>

If you prefer you can _french seam_ the outer edges of the pocket bag together.

</Note>

## bind the top and thread a tie through the binding

There are two methods for binding the top edge. One is to create a loop and the other is to bind with the ties. Read through both methods carefully and decide which one you wish to use.

### Create a loop

- Cut a piece of binding the length of the top edge + seam allowance.
- Fold under the short edges of the binging and stitch in place.
- Bind the top edge of the pocket bag with the prepared binding making sure that the folded ends are left open.
- Thread a tie through the binding.
- Finish the tie ends.

<Tip>

use a piece of tape as binding and tie, sewing it down to the top and leaving the ends free

</Tip>

### Bind with the ties

- Use a piece of tape as binding and tie, attach the pocket bag to the centre of the tape.
- Bind the top edge of the pocket bag whilst leaving the remainder of tape free.
- Finish the tape ends.

## Step 3: Enjoy!

That's it! You're all done! Now go stuff your new pockets to the brim!
