title: "Octoplushy, the plushy octopus: Sewing Instructions"
---

- Sew 4 parts 1 together, from B to A. For Squid: Sew one part 4 to each, from B to A.
  - For Octoplushy: Use topstitching, or a long bar-tack, to make the mouth on one of the segments.
  - For Octopus: Sew the eye part 6 (black) to part 3 (white). Sew both short ends of part 9 together, creating a ring. Sew part 9 to the circumpherence of part 3, gathering the excess as you go. Now fold the part 9 double, and sew it to part 3. You can stuff it before this step if you want more dramatic 'eyebrows'. Sew the eyes to the lower part of the sections, so that you will have two sections between them when it all come together.
  - For Squid: Sew the eye parts together (3 = white, 6 = black) and finish their sides the best you can. Sew these to the section closest to the legs.
  - For Squid: Sew one part 4 to each of the body parts.
- Sew both body parts together, from B to A.
- Sew 4 parts 2 together, from D to C.
  - For Squid: Sew one part 5 to each, from D to C.
- Sew both leg parts together, but only along one seam from D to C. The other stays open to fill the plushy.
- Match up the leg parts with the body parts. Sew each leg from B/D to B/D. It is easiest to sew one leg almost to the next B/D part, stop sewing, pin the next leg, and start sewing again. The bottom part (2,5) is slightly shorter than the top part of a leg, so you have to ease it in while matching it up.
- Fill the plushy
- Hand sew the remaining seam
