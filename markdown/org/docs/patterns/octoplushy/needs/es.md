title: "Octoplushy, the plushy octopus: What You Need"
---

To make Octoplushy, you will need the following:

- [Basic sewing supplies](/docs/sewing/basic-sewing-supplies)
- About 1 meter (1.1 yards) of a suitable fabric (Upper body) ([see Octoplushy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/fabric/))
- About 0.75 meters (0.85 yards) of a suitable fabric (Belly) ([see Octoplushy Fabric options](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/fabric/))
- Stuffing

<Note>

This list is based on a default Octoplushy and you may need less or more fabric dependant on the [size you are making Octoplushy](/docs/patterns/octoplushy/options/size/). The Octopus version requires about 50% more fabric, and the squid version about 75% more.
