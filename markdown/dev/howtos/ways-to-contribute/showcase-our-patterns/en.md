## Tips for great pictures

Below are just a few easy tips and tricks for your Showcase post. 
Of course, any Showcase is infinitely better than nothing, so go ahead and send us those low-light mirror selfies - we love them.

But if you want to take things to the next level, a few things to consider:

### Show it all
Show the whole garment. From multiple angles, if possible. 
It's awesome to see garments from the front, but back and side views can be really helpful, too. 
Bonus points for adding in a seated picture, which are especially great for sewists who use a wheelchair.

### Embrace the light
Take pictures in the best light you can — that might be next to a bright window, 
in a room where you've turned on all the extra lamps you could find, 
or that elusive "golden hour" outdoors. 
Bonus points if you can make it bright enough to not need a flash.

### Background
A neutral background can be helpful for seeing details. 
Try to avoid black on black or another setting that makes it hard to see what is what.

And remember that the outdoors is often the best background.

### Close-ups

If you nailed that welt pocket or hand-stitched all your buttonholes, go ahead and show them off.
Close-up pictures make the showcase so much more relevant for people looking to make the same thing.
